## Continued Development
This project is continuously being enhanced, with the following planned updates and features:

### Planned Featur

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)****: Add an extra layer of security by implementing two-factor authentication via SMS or email for more secure user sign-ins.

- **Social Media Login**: Enable users to log in using their existing social media accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter) for faster and more convenient sign-in.

- **Account Management**: Implement features that allow users to update their profiles, change their passwords, and delete accounts.

- **Login/Sign-Up Animations**: Improve the user experience with smooth animations during transitions between the login and sign-up forms.

- **Remember Me**: Add a "Remember Me" option for users to stay logged in across sessions, reducing the need to log in every time.

### Improvements:

- **Mobile Optimization**: Further enhance the design for smaller screens, ensuring users can easily interact with the form on mobile devices.

- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Ensure the form is fully accessible, with proper contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

- **Backend Integration**: Integrate the form with backend authentication systems (e.g., Firebase, Node.js, or other server-side technologies) to securely handle login and sign-up requests.

- **Security Enhancements**: Implement additional security measures like encryption for passwords and security questions for password recovery.

### Bugs to Fix:

- **Error Message Clarity**: Improve the clarity of error messages, making it easier for users to understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

- **Session Management**: Ensure proper session handling and automatic logout after a period of inactivity to enhance security.
